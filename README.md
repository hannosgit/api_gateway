# Source Code for the Synchronous Implementation of the API Gateway

This repository contains the source code for the synchronous implementation of the API gateway.
The service exposes a single endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/order/:orderId` that returns the aggregated details of an
order.

## Branches of Repository

Each branch of this repository contains a variant of this implementation.
The implementation was configured to use Apache Tomcat or Jetty as the web server.
Both web servers were tested with platform threads and virtual threads as worker threads.

| Branch Name     | Web Server | (Worker) Thread Type |
|-----------------|------------|----------------------|
| platform_tomcat | Tomcat     | Platform             |
| virtual_tomcat  | Tomcat     | Virtual              |
| platform_jetty  | Jetty      | Platform             |
| virtual_jetty   | Jetty      | Virtual              |

## Build Project

Maven is the chosen build tool for this project.

The project can be built with following command:

```
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage
```

## Start Service

The address of the backend service to be called is configured via Spring properties.
The following properties define the addresses:

* ``service.address.auth`` - the address of the authentication service
* ``service.address.bill`` - the address of the billing service
* ``service.address.delivery`` - the address of the delivery service

The following command shows how to start service with all three backend services running on the same address:

```
java -jar target/api_gateway_reactive-1.0-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar --service.address.auth=10.1.0.5:3000 --service.address.bill=10.1.0.5:3000 --service.address.delivery=10.1.0.5:3000
```
